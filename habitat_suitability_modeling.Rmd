This first graph shows wolverine observations in Montana, by QQLL cell. I used a logarithmic scale so that cells with some, but not many wolverine sightings can still be shown. I will later use this observational data to model how different climatic variables affect wolverine habitat. I will likely model these variables against a binary or Boolean variable representing wolverine observations, rather than the observational data that's represented in this graph; areas that are more populated by humans are more likely to have wolverine observations, so using a variable that states simply whether or not wolverines have been observed in that area in the past will do a better job of representing whether the habitat is suitable to wolverines or not.

This next graph shows where ice and snow can be found year-round in Montana using QQLL cells. I included this graph because, when comparing it to the map of wolverine observations, it's very easy to detect a pattern. As expected, wolverines are more common in snowy/icy areas. When I model these variables later on, I expect that I will see a very strong relationship between whether a QQLL cell contains perennial ice/snow and whether wolverines have been observed there before.
```{r}

montana_final$perennial_icesnow <- as.factor(montana_final$perennial_icesnow)

ggplot(montana_final) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=perennial_icesnow))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title="Perennial Ice and Snow in Montana", x= "Longitude", y="Latitude", fill="", caption="Data courtesy of MTNHP, USDA")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("1" = "lightblue","0" = "forestgreen"),
                    labels = c("1" = "Ice/Snow Can Be Found Year-Round", "0" = "No Perennial Ice/Snow"))
```
These two plots show the average annual temperature in Montana by QQLL cell, and the average annual precipitation in Montana by QQLL cell. These are important variables for my project because they both likely have a significant impact on whether a certain location is suitable for wolverines. Interestingly, it seems as though there is a bit of a pattern between the two plots: temperature and rainfall seem to have an inverse relationship in Montana.
```{r}

ggplot(montana_final) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=temp))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title="Average Annual Temperature in Montana, by QQLL Cell", x= "Longitude", y="Latitude", fill="Temperature (Â°F)", caption="Data courtesy of MTNHP, USDA")+
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential("Heat")

ggplot(montana_final) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=inches))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title="Average Annual Rainfall in Montana, by QQLL Cell", x= "Longitude", y="Latitude", fill="Precipitation (Inches)", caption="Data courtesy of MTNHP, USDA")+
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential("Blues 3")
```
I made this next graph to see if there was more of a bell curve to the distributions of temperature and precipitation in QQLL cells that contain wolverine observations compared to the overall distributions. This would suggest that wolverines have "ideal" temperature and precipitation values, rather than simply preferring colder temperatures/more precipitation. As you can see, the distributions of QQLL cells with wolverine observations do more closely resemble bell curves. Because of this, I have found the "ideal" temperature and precipitation values for wolverines, and have assigned each cell variables for their deviations from these ideal values. Obviously, the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and wolverine habitat is a lot more nuanced than this, but I'm somewhat limited by the abilities of QGIS' raster calculator, so this is what seemed to make the most sense to me.

grid.arrange(obs_temp, obs_prec, all_temp, all_prec, ncol = 2,
             top = "Do Wolverines Prefer Specific Weather?",
             bottom = "Data courtesy of MTNHP, USDA")

# Finds "ideal" temperature and precipitation values for wolverine habitat
montana_final$ideal_temp <- median(filter(montana_final, obs > 0)$temp)
montana_final$ideal_prec <- median(filter(montana_final, obs > 0)$inches)
# Finds each qqll's deviation from the ideal temperature and precipitation values
montana_final$temp_dif <- abs(montana_final$temp-montana_final$ideal_temp)
montana_final$prec_dif <- abs(montana_final$inches-montana_final$ideal_prec)

```
I made this next plot to explore the relationship between temperature and precipitation, and how these variables interact to affect the likelihood of observing a wolverine. As expected, there is a negative relationship between temperature and rainfall. It appears as though wolverines prefer colder temperatures and rainier weather. We will see how true this is once I model these variables, along with landcover type.
